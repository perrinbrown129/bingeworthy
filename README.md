# bingeworthy app

## Approach

Initialy, I wanted to create an app that featured adoptable dogs whose breeds were typically seen as less desirable. However, because the Petfinder app was unavailable to use, I decided to pivot and use the TV Maze API to list television shows created by women. Once again, I was thwarted by the API and had to settle to filter television shows based on qualities like their runtime, category, type, etc. Third time was the charm and I could not manage to create more than one data filter on my site so had to settle with creating multiple buttons that correspond to the show categories in the API to filter out shows based on a user's genre preference.
